# ASR_WEB-APP
Here we have a web app where user can select one asr model out of two given Braj ASR models and can upload a wav audio file and get the transcription.
We have used django for this web app development.
To get the transcription first download the given folders and unzip them and put in one new folder and open terminal after going in this new folder on your local device, then run the command "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal, it will generate a URL which you can paste on your browser and you will be directed to the Homepage of the webapp.
